***Full-Stack MERN Application***
The project evaluated the ability to use (MongoDB/Express/React/Node.js) Stack application

**Photographer Project Library**

This app is designed to help photographers keep their photography projects(photo shoots) in one place.This application allows to Create, Read, Update and Delete users.As the users get in their accounts], they should be able to Create, Readm Update and Delete the details of their projects along with the contents of the projects. 

 This Photographers' Projects library will mainly hold the information about their photo shoots(types),with  dates, locations and equipment used for that particular photoshoot.

/*Technologies and libraries I used:

 React.js,
  Node.js with Express,
 MongoDB,
 Mongoose 
 React Router and Styled Component packages



To this project,I would like to add:

User authentication
-The ability for  users to perform a full add,update and delete their photos.
-I intend to get the second and third model working, for this library to take its full shape. The nestesd routes are not easy; but as a developer I  certainly wold like to achieve it. 
-A way for users to share collections of thier photo shoots with other users



During this project, I used the differnt syntax in the code, it is not a great way of coding. However, the code provided functionality for a full crud to atleast one model. I learnt alot about the complexity and the functionality of how the code works. It was challening to bring everything together. I understand alot of the code that is written out; I tried to comment at some code.


My major takeaways:

Better understanding of backend and front end functionality. 
Understanding the complexity of the components in react.
Understanding how the routing works, and the flow of the data between client and server such objects, arrays, array of objects. 
which made it some what easy to achieve CRUD function. I understand as the flow of data gets more nested it becomes more complex;however I feel that it can be achieved once e understand the fundamental basics of how thing move around in MERN Full Stack Application. 

I understand more how important it is to identify the relationships between models via Entity Relationship Diagrams. The application is a mostly loops running and picking the ids through each model. I got a relative understanding of devtools and its usage, which helped me debug through errors.And invest into them a bit more deeply. This project -MERN application is not an easy one. How ever with my expereince I can conclude that it is acheievable. As much as it was challenging, it was also sort of fun with a good sense achievement.
