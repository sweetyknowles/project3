Full-Stack MERN Application
The project evaluated my ability to use (MongoDB/Express/React/Node.js) Stack application

Photographer Project Library

This app is designed to help photographers keep their each photography session(photo shoots) in one place under projects. Since photographers will be able to have their own user profile, where they can add, delete, update their projects and thier user accounts. This library will hold the information about their photo shoots,such as the date, type of the shoot, location and who was the model including the equipment used for each photo session.

Technologies and libraries I used:

 React.js, Node.js with Express, MongoDB, Mongoose and all of the dependencies that each of those packages 
 React Router and Styled Component packages



As I developed this app, I used various syntax to make sure I understood the variations. For example, in the same component or router, I used both .then and async/await versions of promises. I understand this is not a good way to build production code, but I wanted to use the project to improve my understanding of the syntax options. I have made comments in the code to explain my method.
Major takeaways:

Mobile first is (still) hard; I made progress on mobile first since my last project, but I still had issues. I wanted to fix some of the styling suggestions from the instructors for the second project. I had to do some trial and error styling because Google dev tools does not take into account the mobile browser tool bars for safari. I am sure there are still some issues for other mobile browsers.
Understanding the "shape" of the data; Shape of the data is definitely (probably) a phrase I made up. Once I got a good handle on how the data was passing between the client and the server (object, array, array of objects, etc), I was able to fly through the CRUD functions for both updating the database and setting the state.
Systems thinking is valuable; This is an extension of the previous takeaway. The value of applying the models from basic systems thinking to the development of complex full-stack applications cannot be overstated. The entire app is just a series of feedback loops. Once I understood the cause and effect relationships between the individual elements of the system, I was able to isolate the points of leverage, and then I could select the most efficient solution to each problem.
Reviewing previous takeaways; This is a carryover from the last project, but still played such a huge part of this project that I feel like I must include it. I believe iterative learning is important enough to justify this takeaway.
