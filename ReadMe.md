About this project:

I developed an application that allows users to build flashcards to study for tests.

Technologies and libraries I used:

I used React.js, Node.js with Express, MongoDB, Mongoose and all of the dependencies that each of those packages have
I also used React Router and Styled Component packages
In Version 2, I would like to add:

User authentication
A more skeuomorphic UI for the flashcard review
Progressive Web App features so the flashcards can be reviewed offline
A way for users to share collections of flashcards with other users
I used different syntax in places

As I developed this app, I used various syntax to make sure I understood the variations. For example, in the same component or router, I used both .then and async/await versions of promises. I understand this is not a good way to build production code, but I wanted to use the project to improve my understanding of the syntax options. I have made comments in the code to explain my method.
Major takeaways:

Mobile first is (still) hard; I made progress on mobile first since my last project, but I still had issues. I wanted to fix some of the styling suggestions from the instructors for the second project. I had to do some trial and error styling because Google dev tools does not take into account the mobile browser tool bars for safari. I am sure there are still some issues for other mobile browsers.
Understanding the "shape" of the data; Shape of the data is definitely (probably) a phrase I made up. Once I got a good handle on how the data was passing between the client and the server (object, array, array of objects, etc), I was able to fly through the CRUD functions for both updating the database and setting the state.
Systems thinking is valuable; This is an extension of the previous takeaway. The value of applying the models from basic systems thinking to the development of complex full-stack applications cannot be overstated. The entire app is just a series of feedback loops. Once I understood the cause and effect relationships between the individual elements of the system, I was able to isolate the points of leverage, and then I could select the most efficient solution to each problem.
Reviewing previous takeaways; This is a carryover from the last project, but still played such a huge part of this project that I feel like I must include it. I believe iterative learning is important enough to justify this takeaway.
